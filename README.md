Understanding women and the trends that shape the indian menstrual market through data collection and visualisation 
Anmut is a data-driven exploration of the menstrual product landscape in India — where tradition, taboo, innovation, and feminine strength intersect. This project blends market analytics, consumer sentiment, and product mapping to uncover how menstrual care is evolving from a basic hygiene category into a bold, intelligent femtech movement centered around dignity, choice, and comfort.
